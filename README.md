# MC-Integral-Buffon-Needle
## About
This repo includes my work of (1)Boffon's Needle simulation; (2)finite integral calculation. 
### Boffon's Needle
Boffon's Needle is a Monte Carlo method of calculating $\pi$. The detailed report is in `report-ch.pdf`. Actually this is an assignment of Probability Theory and Stochastic Process.
I not only calculated $\pi$ with MC, but also analyze the factor that may influence the error, including number of simulations and data type (fp4/fp8/fp16/fp32/fp64). 
## Finite Integral
Finite integral is another work related to MC. I finished the calculation and analyze possible factors influencing the result accuracy.
